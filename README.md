EventiGo
=======

Source code for my project EventiGo written in Laravel. It lists real upcoming events and venues along with fake users and ticket prices. Uses this data to tell the user how much he should charge in order to drive the most revenue for future events. 

In the website look in the admin page to see graphs of the data representation. 

`/data` directory contains all the data along with the python scripts used to scrape that data.
