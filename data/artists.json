        "bio": "One of the most prominent Latin-born performers of the pop era, singer/guitarist Jose Feliciano was born September 10, 1945, in Lares, Puerto Rico; the victim of congenital glaucoma, he was left permanently blind at birth. Five years later, he and his family moved to New York City's Spanish Harlem area; there Feliciano began learning the accordion, later taking up the guitar and making his first public appearance at the Bronx's El Teatro Puerto Rico at the age of nine. While in high school he became a fixture of the Greenwich Village coffeehouse circuit, eventually quitting school in 1962 in order to accept a permanent gig in Detroit; a contract with RCA followed a performance at New York's Gerde's Folk City, and within two years he appeared at the Newport Jazz Festival. After bowing with the 1964 novelty single \"Everybody Do the Click,\" he issued his flamenco-flavored debut LP The Voice and Guitar of Jose Feliciano, trailed early the next year by The Fantastic Feliciano.\n\nUnhappy with the direction of his music following the release of 1966's A Bag Full of Soul, Feliciano returned to his roots, releasing three consecutive Spanish-language LPs -- Sombras...Una Voz, Una Guitarra, Mas Exitos de Jose Feliciano and El Sentimiento, La Voz y La Guitarra de Jose Feliciano -- on RCA International, scoring on the Latin pop charts with the singles \"La Copa Rota\" and \"Amor Gitana.\" With 1968's Feliciano!, he scored a breakthrough hit with a soulful reading of the Doors' \"Light My Fire\" that launched him into the mainstream pop stratosphere; a smash cover of Tommy Tucker's R&B chestnut \"Hi Heel Sneakers\" solidified his success, and soon Feliciano found himself performing the national anthem during the 1968 World Series. His idiosyncratic Latin-jazz performance of the song proved highly controversial, and despite the outcry of traditionalists and nationalists, his status as an emerging counterculture hero was secured, with a single of his rendition also becoming a hit.\n\nIn 1969 Feliciano recorded three LPs -- Souled, Alive Alive-O, and Feliciano 10 to 23 -- and won a Grammy for Best New Artist; however, he never again equalled the success of \"Light My Fire,\" and only the theme song to the sitcom Chico and the Man subsequently achieved hit status, edging into the Top 100 singles chart in 1974. Throughout the 1970s Feliciano remained an active performer, however, touring annually and issuing a number of LPs in both English and Spanish, including 1973's Steve Cropper-produced Compartments; he also appeared on the Joni Mitchell hit \"Free Man in Paris,\" and guested on a number of television series including Kung Fu and McMillan and Wife. In 1980 Feliciano was the first performer signed to the new Latin division of Motown, making his label debut with an eponymous effort the following year; his recorded output tapered off during the course of the decade, although he occasionally resurfaced with LPs including 1987's Tu Immenso Amor and 1989's I'm Never Gonna Change. A school in East Harlem was renamed the Jose Feliciano Performing Arts School in his honor; in 1996, he also appeared briefly in the hit film Fargo.",

        "bio": "Superklaus is a pop sensation megaboost from the UNITED STATES. \n\nNow read some Marcus Aurelius:\n\nWhen we have meat before us and such eatables we receive the impression, that this is the dead body of a fish, and this is the dead body of a bird or of a pig; and again, that this Falernian is only a little grape juice, and this purple robe some sheep's wool dyed with the blood of a shell-fish: such then are these impressions, and they reach the things themselves and penetrate them, and so we see what kind of things they are. Just in the same way ought we to act all through life, and where there are things which appear most worthy of our approbation, we ought to lay them bare and look at their worthlessness and strip them of all the words by which they are exalted. For outward show is a wonderful perverter of the reason, and when thou art most sure that thou art employed about things worth thy pains, it is then that it cheats thee most. Consider then what Crates says of Xenocrates himself. \n\nMost of the things which the multitude admire are referred to objects of the most general kind, those which are held together by cohesion or natural organization, such as stones, wood, fig-trees, vines, olives. But those which are admired by men who are a little more reasonable are referred to the things which are held together by a living principle, as flocks, herds. Those which are admired by men who are still more instructed are the things which are held together by a rational soul, not however a universal soul, but rational so far as it is a soul skilled in some art, or expert in some other way, or simply rational so far as it possesses a number of slaves. But he who values rational soul, a soul universal and fitted for political life, regards nothing else except this; and above all things he keeps his soul in a condition and in an activity conformable to reason and social life, and he co-operates to this end with those who are of the same kind as himself. \n\nSome things are hurrying into existence, and others are hurrying out of it; and of that which is coming into existence part is already extinguished. Motions and changes are continually renewing the world, just as the uninterrupted course of time is always renewing the infinite duration of ages. In this flowing stream then, on which there is no abiding, what is there of the things which hurry by on which a man would set a high price? It would be just as if a man should fall in love with one of the sparrows which fly by, but it has already passed out of sight. Something of this kind is the very life of every man, like the exhalation of the blood and the respiration of the air. For such as it is to have once drawn in the air and to have given it back, which we do every moment, just the same is it with the whole respiratory power, which thou didst receive at thy birth yesterday and the day before, to give it back to the element from which thou didst first draw it.

N.W.A. and Public Enemy are part of the reason that Leq avoids making cookie cutter music and sticks to the real - regardless of genre. That trait alone is part of the reason success is right around the corner for him as he carries limitless love for good music as long as it moves the crowd. \n\nHis resume includes working with artists such as Royce da 5'9, Mr Cheeks, Rza, Big Kap, Next, Rah Digga, Mike Jones to name a few, and has been on tour with 50 Cent, Usher, Dj Quik, Fabolous, The Clipse, Young Jeezy, Busta Rhymes, Shwayze and Cisco, Lupe Fiasco, and more.\n",

Believe that the world\nis an ethereal flower, and ye live! I knew this! I also knew that I was\nthe worst bum in the world. The diamond light was in my eyes.\u201d.. -\nJack Kerouac, The Dharma Bums.  \n\nLos Angeles based rock 'n' soul band The Diamond Light formed over long summers and weekly blues jams back in rural New Hampshire.  Singer and guitarist Griffin Young began writing songs with drummer Ian Ochs almost ten years ago in Ian's father's band.  Playing together in bars with their parents throughout high school, they eventually paired up with guitarist/vocalist Brian Stanley to form the final incarnation of The Diamond Light.  In 2007, the band began to make their way West, with all of the members eventually landing in Southern California.  \n \nAfter two years of writing and playing around LA, they released an EP entitled Krotona in the summer of 2009.  Named after the monastery-turned-apartment complex Griffin and Brian called home, the EP was produced by neighbor-turned-mentor John Chelew (The Blind Boys of Alabama) at Pacifica Studios in Culver City, CA.  2010 saw the release of the energetic, blues-rock driven EP Seeds in the Street, followed by extensive dates around Los Angeles and the Pacific Northwest. Their electric live performances have been fueling a rapidly growing fan base.  \n\nIn 2012, The Diamond Light teamed up with multi-instrumentalist/singer Trevor Menear and began writing material for a full length record. Returning producer Joseph Holiday (Seeds in the Street), and new friend/recording guru Niko Bolas (Neil Young, My Morning Jacket) helped transform their Laurel Canyon rehearsal space into a fully operational recording studio. The resulting 12 songs to emerge from 2 months of writing and documenting in seclusion will form The Diamond Light's debut, full-length record due in late September.\n\n",

        "bio": "They\u02bcve been the soundtrack to countless parties, clubs, car stereos and headphones. They have written and produced chart topping songs for the likes of 50 Cent, JLo, Fantasia and Justin Bieber to name a few. Always known for evolving and reinvention, The MIDI Mafia have transcended from hip hop music producers into Grammy nominated songwriters. Not satisfied with just working behind the scenes, the dynamic duo of Dirty Swift and Bruce Waynne took their love of music and returned to their roots as artists with their debut EP titled \u201cVegas Lights\u201d, spawning 3 music videos, which have generated millions of online views and MTV rotation. Now they are preparing their next collection titled \u201cGet Connected\u201d.\n\nThe #1 Billboard smash \u201c21 Questions\u201d by 50 Cent first put the name MIDI Mafia into\u00a0the minds of music lovers worldwide. Followed by their Grammy nominated single\u00a0\u201cWhen I See U\u201d by Fantasia and \u201cHold It Don\u02bct Drop It\u201d by Jennifer Lopez, they quickly\u00a0became A-list producers with over 20 million albums sold featuring their writing and\u00a0production. Having both started their careers as performers, Canadian born Dirty Swift\u00a0as a championship-winning DJ and Brooklyn native Bruce Waynne as a rapper, they are\u00a0no strangers to the stage and had been developing a new sound inspired by hip hop but\u00a0crossing boundaries and genres with no regards for labels or categories. \n\nAnthemic,\u00a0modern, and driven to make people have fun, their music can only be described as\u00a0\u201cPHamous\u201d!\nThe MIDI Mafia have quickly become media magnets, forming new and unique brand partnerships and even pulling the giant MTV machine into their world, who quickly promoted the group on Season 2 of Jersey Shore and developed a new emerging music platform called \u201cHype Music\u201d in partnership with publishing giant Sony/ATV and their Extreme Production Music division. The MIDI Mafia will be one of the first groups promoted through this hybrid platform.\n\nThe envelope pushes even further for The MIDI Mafia, as castmembers of the MTV reality series \u201cThe Electric Barbarellas\u201d, about a new unsigned 5 girl band who enlist the boys to help develop them. Along with producing the girls on and off screen, the MIDI Mafias first single from the upcoming \u201cGet Connected\u201d album also features the Electric Barbarellas called \u201cPlay Hard\u201d. Says Dirty Swift about the song, \u201cafter spending so much time shooting these huge videos and having a nonstop party, we felt like doing something more human, gritty and fun. Play Hard embodies everyone out there who works hard for what they achieve in life, and having the freedom to enjoy those achievements\u201d.\n\nThe MIDI Mafia sound has evolved as well. After travelling worldwide and playing across the country, including shows in LA, NY and SXSW, the guys have infused more diverse elements into their electro-hip hop sound. Bruce Waynne states \u201cyour going to hear a lot of energy, and we don\u2019t care where it comes from, whether its a guitar, a synth, breaking into Dub Step basslines, whatever moves us is going into this album.\u201d Dirty Swift adds \u201cwe\u2019ve always felt free of limitations or genres, and as long as were having fun we really don\u2019t care about songwriting rules, structure or anything like that. But of course were known for big hooks and huge melodies and that won\u2019t ever change!\u201d\n\nLeave it to The MIDI Mafia to give a fresh perspective on having a good time. Their new album is their masterpiece and the dancefloor will be the canvas. Swift says \u201cwe are having fun with music and thats the reason we\u02bcve been successful. We don\u02bct take ourselves too seriously, its all about making people feel good.\u201d With their innovative approach to the music business, it\u02bcs safe to say The MIDI Mafia will be making people feel good for a very long time. \u201cThe old way of doing things is over\u201d Bruce states, \u201cthere are many different ways to get music to people these days and we are exploring all of the possibilities. Through our strategic partnerships with MTV, SonyATV/Extreme Music, Cosmopolitan, Maker Studios/YouTube, the Caesars Group and all of the other brands and networks that support us we feel that The MIDI Mafia is creating a new model on how to market and distribute music. This is only the beginning and we are excited to get our music to the people in the ways which they really want it, and make it a part of their lifestyles.\u201d Swift adds, \u201cwe are music fans first and foremost, and The MIDI Mafia is a reflection of what we love about music and its ability to evoke emotions in people. We don\u02bct try to separate ourselves from the fans and I think that makes all the difference. We just apply the thought process we have as music consumers and try to think about how I want to have music in my life, and give our music to the people in those same ways.\u201d The MIDI Mafia evolution continues, as artists, producers, songwriters, television stars, content providers. \u201cGet Connected!\u201d",

        "bio": "Fusing together meaningful honest lyrics with soulful melodies, Canadian born, Los Angeles based singer/songwriter Marc Robillard creates his own unique blend of sonic artistry.  He cites Coldplay and Death Cab as music influences; but there are so many delicious inferences woven into his raspy voice that is oh, so seductive. Robillard has a knack for  connecting his bright side of the road songs to alt-pop confections that are hook laden without sounding crushingly commercial. There's an audience for his laid back style and it is just a matter of time before one of his songs hits the mainstream in a very big way.\n\nWith the release of his long-awaited sophomore album \u201cLeft London\u201d, Robillard gives listeners a collection of new tunes that hold a fuller, more elaborate sound while still maintaining his sincere, intimate perspective. Inspired by his time spent in London and his subsequent journey to Los Angeles, \u201cLeft London\u201d is a raw statement from Robillard that showcases the alt-singer/songwriter\u2019s powerfully emotive voice and poetic lyrical depth.\u00a0 The album features Robillard\u2019s penchant for hook-driven melodies that fit seamlessly with the singer\u2019s captivating tone.\n\nThe credits keep piling up for Robillard.\u00a0 After being chosen by MTV and Extreme Music to be a part of their new HYPE project, which showcase\u2019s some of the worlds most up and coming artists, his music will be featured throughout MTV\u2019s programming.  Robillard also achieved commercial success with several of his songs. \u201cSo Much More\u201d was featured in Frito Lay\u2019s green television commercial for a biodegradable Sunchips bag and garnered significant attention from viewers around the globe. His song, \u201cUnfold\u201d off of \u201cLeft London\u201d was chosen to air during an episode of ABC\u2019s primetime hit cop drama Rookie Blue.  His music has been featured on MTV\u2019s hit shows the Jersey Shore, Teen Mom, Caged, Plain Jane, I used to be fat, Savage U, UK\u2019s hit teen drama Skins, Nickelodeon\u2019s Degrassi, VH1\u2019s the TO show.\n\nMarc\u2019s tracks have hit the ground running with the recent re-invigoration of the adult-alternative indie scene. This cyclical road has again been freshly paved by newcomers like The Lumineers, Fun., Ed Sheeran, and Of Monsters and Men. These artists and the like have been tearing up the charts and simultaneously breathing new life into the genre. Robillard\u2019s self-taught ability to craft honest, ubiquitously relevant music is thrusting him towards being right alongside the aforementioned artists, and his recent syncs only back up that claim.\n\nA self-taught musician, Robillard plays both the guitar and piano. Initially interested in music production, he worked in several music studios across Canada while he began writing his first album. While composing music for a Toronto production company in 2005, Robillard released \u201cPaper Airplanes\u201d to glowing reviews from fans and critics alike.\nBorn in Montreal, Robillard spent most of his childhood and teenage years playing competitive hockey, drafted to play in the Ontario Hockey League, one of the top junior hockey leagues in the world.\n\n\"Contagious\", the first single to be released from his debut album Left London, is now being spun on more than 30 radio stations across Canada. The Ripple Effect says, \u201cRobillard is an alternative rock balladeer in the vein of David Grey, and the results are phenomenal.\u201d \"Left London is a brilliant album,\u201d says Powerpopaholic. \u201cYou should keep your eye out for Marc Robillard,\u201d notes Stereoboard UK.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "bio": "From his forays in drum and bass to his mainstream pop-appeal, Atlantic Connection has maintained a solid sense of soul & depth in every musical direction he\u2019s chosen to pursue. With a 10 year career and an intimidating discography, AC has firmly established himself as one of EDM\u2019s most visionary artists. Raised in Boston, now residing in Los Angeles, Atlantic Connection\u2019s background in music began from early childhood. Growing up in a family immersed in music and culture, AC\u2019s natural creative inclinations were implicitly supported, and therefore allowed him to develop himself though these musical creations. \n\nBy the age of 20, Atlantic Connection released his first record under guise Basic Operations on the San Francisco label Phuturo Recordings. This paved the way for a string of releases on some of the world\u2019s top drum & bass labels including Creative Source, Renegade, CIA, Human, Freak, Tangent/Beta, V Recordings & Liquid V and many more. In 2008 Atlantic Connection released his first full length album \u201cTomorrow\u2019s Not Enough,\" a discriminating mix of hip hop, drum & bass and electro house. The album featured some of EDM\u2019s strongest performers including Armanni Reign, Tali and Whiskey Pete which ultimately made it a summer success, resulting in licensing deals with Global Underground & VH1.\n\nFirmly establishing himself in the ranks of EDM, and quickly infiltrating the commercial world, Atlantic Connection took a hiatus to Hawaii to begin work on his sophomore album in 2009. He returned to Los Angeles inspired from island life and immediately let the music juices flow. The following two years, AC also took the commercial music world by storm. His high musical output amassed the attention of Viacom Media and Hype Music (Extreme Music/MTV) which led to him ultimately producing music for 15+ TV shows across the networks. Companies including Harmonix Video Games (Dance Central 2), MTV Films, Paramount and Fox TV came knocking on his door soon after.\n\nThe completion of his second album \u201cLove Architect\u201d in the spring of 2012 sees Atlantic Connection returning to his roots in soul and bass. Featuring songs with New York\u2019s Shannon Swain, a remix by Kastle and flavors spanning the entire spectrum of groove, \u201cLove Architect\u201d is already being heralded as a success. The massive \u201cMy Love\u201d featuring Tali has hit the daytime air waves on New Zealand\u2019s 96.6 GeorgeFM station. The future is bright for AC, he\u2019s preparing to host a new radio show, working on a clothing company, kicking off a new record label and continuing to produce nonstop for a wide array of media & artists.\n\nAtlantic Connection\u2019s dynamic approach to music has lead him down many paths and experiences, but regardless of his creative direction, one thing we can always count on is his uncanny ability to create a soulful experience through his music.\n",

        "bio": "Born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area, Dean J. Grenier, (A.K.A DJG), landed in the Bay Area underground dance music scene 2006 with his first 12\u201d  \u201dShadow Skanking\u201d b/w \u201cJoyful Sound\u201d on Narco.Hz, two slices of lithe, slick dubstep. Immediate airplay for \u201cJoyful Sound\u201d on Rinse FM and drops in the clubs from prominent DJs like N-Type quickly propelled DJG to the forefront of American bass music producers early on in his career.\n\nGrenier\u2019s production style is rich and welcoming, sometimes visceral but never anything less than evocative.  Now considered a veteran of the American scene, Grenier (as DJG) self-released the two-disc Voids collection in 2010, revealing not only a clever grasp of dubstep and dnb but ambient soundscapes, and since then he\u2019s released on labels like Gilles Peterson\u2019s Brownswood imprint, Headhunter\u2019s Transistor, Frite Nite, Pushing Red and Wheel & Deal Records. Now operating under the name Grenier his recent productions see him moving in a more experimental direction, dropping the tempo to as low as 125BPM while playing around with rhythmic structures that hint at soulful house, garage, and other weird shapes, all imbued with the warm melodic embrace he\u2019s always kept hidden beneath the beats.  With forthcoming releases on Tectonic, Photek Productions, Get Darker and Frite Nite (with LA\u2019s Salva), 2012 looks to be a banner year for Grenier, as he continues work on his debut album. DJs ranging from Mary Anne Hobbs, Mala, Pearson Sound, 2562, Pinch, Addison Groove, Salva, Photek, N-Type, Distal and many more have been supporting DJG\u2019s recent and forthcoming releases. \n\nGrenier\u2019s performance behind the decks reveals a wide-ranging taste and smart grip on all sorts of music, elegantly-paced sets full of his own productions and like-minded efforts from others. His DJ talents have brought him all over the world, including a recent set at the legendary club Fabric in London and a tour around Europe in 2011, and back home in North America he\u2019s headlined British Columbia\u2019s Bass Coast Festival.\n\nAffiliations:  Tectonic, Photek Productions, Frite Nite, GetDarker, Transistor, Pushing Red, Wheel&Deal, Lo Dubs, Warm Communications, Narco.Hz, Subway, Tube10, Noppa",

Well-versed in a number of instruments including piano, guitar, and Javanese gamelan, she has used her infectious melodies and captivating lyrics to appeal to a wide range of audiences, gaining admiration on YouTube and blog sites alike. Some of her most notable work includes her vocal appearances on some of MTV's hit shows including the top-rated Jersey Shore and work with some of the industry's hottest producers, including Grammy- nominated Bei Maejor.

In these quiet moments symphonic landscapes emerge to form the headphone-centric Seven Saturdays.\n\nSeven Saturdays makes you feel as if you're on those late night drives, creating music with delicate keyboards and distant vocals that tug at your heart strings. While recorded in Los Angeles, Seven Saturdays strays from your typical indie rock band. The recordings of Seven Saturdays comprise an impressive list of talented musicians including: Morgan Kibby (M83), Mike Garson (David Bowie, Smashing Pumpkins), Wesley Precourt (Dave Stewart, Jenny Lewis), and Eric Heywood (The Pretenders, Ray LaMontagne).\n\nIn early 2010, Seven Saturdays released a self-titled EP which Stereogum described as \"gripping and mellowly epic\" and spent 6 weeks on CMJ's Top 200 Radio charts. Now Haskell is releasing the Secret Things remix EP, which includes a reworked track by Sun Airway that Pitchfork described as \"sparkling\" (other contributers are: Memoryhouse, White Sea, Teen Daze, Houses and Millionyoung), and a collection of ambient recordings entitled Love In The Time Of Anticipated Defeat, out now on Dynamophone Records.",

        "bio": "The Knocks\nMagic EP\n\nWhen it comes to origin stories, The Knocks have a good one. After meeting at The New School in New York City, Ben \u201cB-Roc\u201d Ruttner and James \u201cJPatt\u201d Patterson both found themselves in need of a place to live. The two moved in together, and quickly set about making their neighbors hate them. \u201cOur apartment is this small, shitty Avenue C apartment with paper thin walls. We both had studio set-ups in our rooms,\u201d explains B-Roc. \u201cIt would be loud as hell, and the neighbors hated it. They\u2019d knock on the walls and bang on the ceiling. We would go into each other\u2019s rooms and say \u2018I just got The Knocks.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn the five years leading up to the release of the new Magic EP, everything has changed for The Knocks \u2013 except their address. They\u2019ve been declared by the NME as one of the \u201c20 hottest producers in music\u201d and are now one of the most buzzed-about duos on the dance circuit. Described as \u201cmidway between David Guetta and Daft Punk\u201d by The Guardian and hailed as \u201ccred-pop\u2019s answer to the Neptunes\u201d by the NME, JPatt\u2019s background in soul and funk and B-Roc\u2019s years spent immersed in trip-hop and hip-hop beats has allowed them to quickly ascend the production ranks. The Knocks\u2019 early success led them to a publishing deal for their original material and innovative remixing of songs for global superstars and exciting indie acts like Lady Gaga, Rihanna, Ellie Goulding, Chiddy Bang, Foster The People, Passion Pit, Marina and the Diamonds and Britney Spears. While they enjoy producing and remixing for other artists, they eventually found themselves experimenting with sounds of their own.\n\nB-Roc and JPatt didn\u2019t think much would come of a nearly five-minute track they had been building, all tense beats and tingling synths. \u201cIt kind of started out as a joke,\u201d says B-Roc. \u201cBut people were liking that more than the stuff we produced for other people,\u201d says B-Roc. \u201cIt felt right.\u201d The duo quickly discovered a newfound freedom in creating their own songs. \u201cIt's better because it's ours, and we can do whatever we want with it,\u201d explains JPatt.\n\nWhen The Knocks realized the chord they\u2019d struck, they opened their own custom-built studio Heavy Roc Music on the Lower East Side in New York City. Over the past two years, the duo has been jet-setting around the globe for DJ gigs, sharing stages with M.I.A., Sleigh Bells, Scissor Sisters, Die Antwoord, DJ Shadow and Chromeo and releasing infectious dance-pop singles that have turned The Knocks into blog darlings. After releasing \u201cDancing with the DJ\u201d in 2010 via Heavy Roc (also included on the Magic EP), the song shot to #1 on Hype Machine and hit #1 on Japan\u2019s Electronic Songs Chart. They released their next single \u201cMake It Better\u201d on Neon Gold Records and were playlisted on Australia\u2019s #1 radio station Triple J and BBC Radio One \u2013 early evidence that The Knocks\u2019 music would resonate around the globe. They recently signed to A&M/Octone Records and Magic is their first release with the label.\n\n\nB-Roc and JPatt have managed an impressive feat on Magic \u2013 they make electronic music sound organic, installing a soul amongst all the ones and zeros. The Knocks have captured all the anticipation and energy of an evening filled with possibilities. \u201cThe whole vibe of the EP is this magic hour, that feeling you get when you go out and you\u2019re having the best night ever,\u201d says B-Roc. Each song is a variation on this theme, nodding at some genre of music before inverting it and putting a Knocksian spin on it. The title track \u201cMagic,\u201d featuring British singer/producer Gary Go, sets the tone for the EP, slowly blooming into warm harmonies and anchored by steady, hand-struck drums. First single \"Brightside\" lit up dance floors when the band leaked the song on Soundcloud in early October, garnering an impressive 30,000 streams in just one week, and snagging the top spot on the Hype Machine Twitter Chart.\n\n\u201cR.O.Y.L\u201d is a nu-disco nod with a touch of Motown vocals. \u201cThat track is all of our influences in one song,\u201d says JPatt. \"The Prize\" opens on an off-kilter synth line before becoming a four-on-the-floor banger. EP closer \"All We Got\" featuring Kardinal Offishall, echoes with reverb-drenched vocals and an irresistible, staggering piano line.\n\n\u201cWe want to put out good songs,\u201d says JPatt. \u201cNot a dance song, or a hip-hop song. A good song.\u201d With Magic, they\u2019ve managed an EP full of them.\n\nThe Knocks are currently in the studio completing their debut full-length album, set for release in 2013.",

        "bio": "It is with great sadness that we confirm that musician, rapper, activist and director Adam \"MCA\" Yauch, founding member of Beastie Boys and also of the Milarepa Foundation that produced the Tibetan Freedom Concert benefits, and film production and distribution company Oscilloscope Laboratories, passed away in his native New York City this morning after a near-three-year battle with cancer. He was 47 years old.\n\nBorn in Brooklyn, New York, Yauch taught himself to play bass in high school, forming a band for his 17th birthday party that would later become known the world over as Beastie Boys.\n\nWith fellow members Michael \"Mike D\" Diamond and Adam \"Adrock\" Horovitz, Beastie Boys would go on to sell over 40 million records, release four #1 albums\u2013including the first hip hop album ever to top the Billboard 200, the band's 1986 debut full length, Licensed To Ill\u2013win three Grammys, and the MTV Video Vanguard Lifetime Achievement award. Last month Beastie Boys were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, with Diamond and Horovitz reading an acceptance speech on behalf of Yauch, who was unable to attend.\n\nIn addition to his hand in creating such historic Beastie Boys albums as Paul's Boutique, Check Your Head, Ill Communication, Hello Nasty and more, Yauch was a founder of the Milarepa Fund, a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting awareness and activism regarding the injustices perpetrated on native Tibetans by Chinese occupational government and military forces. In 1996, Milarepa produced the first Tibetan Freedom Concert in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park, which was attended by 100,000 people, making it the biggest benefit concert on U.S. soil since 1985's Live Aid. The Tibetan Freedom Concert series would continue to stage some of the most significant benefit shows in the world for nearly a decade following in New York City, Washington DC, Tokyo, Sydney, Amsterdam, Taipei and other cities.\n\nIn the wake of September 11, 2001, Milarepa organized New Yorkers Against Violence, a benefit headlined by Beastie Boys at New York's Hammerstein Ballroom, with net proceeds disbursed to the New York Women's Foundation Disaster Relief Fund and the New York Association for New Americans (NYANA) September 11th Fund for New Americans\u2013each chosen for their efforts on behalf of 9/11 victims least likely to receive help from other sources.\n\nUnder the alias of Nathanial H\u00f6rnblow\u00e9r, Yauch directed iconic Beastie Boys videos including \"So Whatcha Want,\" \"Intergalactic,\" \"Body Movin\" and \"Ch-Check It Out.\" Under his own name, Yauch directed last year's Fight For Your Right Revisited, an extended video for \"Make Some Noise\" from Beastie Boys' Hot Sauce Committee Part Two, starring Elijah Wood, Danny McBride and Seth Rogen as the 1986 Beastie Boys, making their way through a half hour of cameo-studded misadventures before squaring off against Jack Black, Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly as Beastie Boys of the future.\n\nYauch's passion and talent for filmmaking led to his founding of Oscilloscope Laboratories, which in 2008 released his directorial film debut, the basketball documentary Gunnin' For That #1 Spot and has since become a major force in independent video distribution, amassing a catalogue of such acclaimed titles as Kelly Reichardt's Wendy and Lucy, Oren Moverman's The Messenger, Banksy's Exit Through The Gift Shop, Lance Bangs and Spike Jonze's Tell Them Anything You Want: A Portrait Of Maurice Sendak, and many more.\n\nYauch is survived by his wife Dechen and his daughter Tenzin Losel, as well as his parents Frances and Noel Yauch.",

        "bio": "In the world of contemporary music, there are just a handful of superstars whose first name alone brings instant recognition. Check Aretha, Whitney, Mariah, Diana and Dionne. But when it comes to male vocalists, the list is far shorter. One name towers above the rest in any discussion of black male singers whose impact and influence has been unparalleled. Say the name \u201cLuther\u201d and record buyers the world over respond immediately. The fact is, Luther Vandross was, and always will be, the pre-eminent black male vocalist of our time.\n\nIn the years since Luther\u2019s passing, one constant has remained to define his life and musical success: the voice. Like any great singer of the past 100 years, Luther Vandross' voice and distinct singing style led to not only monumental success, but an instant recognition when you hear him singing--through your stereo, car radio, on TV or in a movie. Bing. Frank. Billie. Robeson. Aretha. Diana. Dionne. Whitney. Mariah. Michael. Marvin. Luther. It is rarified company, but indelibly classic and everlasting in the annals of American music and a club in which Luther Vandross\u2019 membership is permanent.\n\nCoupled with that voice was Luther\u2019s unique ability to write and sing about love and the shared emotions we all feel in that search for and enjoyment of love. Love of family, friends, that special someone--all were themes Luther explored with his music regularly, reaching many. Through his songs, for the last two generations Luther Vandross became a staple in the most joyous moments of people\u2019s lives.\n\nAt the time of Luther's death in 2005 following complications from a stroke two years earlier, Luther had been in entertainment for 35 years. From his introduction to the world as a singer on the first season of PBS's Sesame Street in 1969 to winning four Grammy Awards in 2004, Luther was a permanent and dynamic force in popular music. He crossed boundaries, starting with his earliest success as a background vocalist and arranger for David Bowie, Bette Midler, Barbra Streisand, Donna Summer, Carly Simon, Judy Collins, J. Geils Band, Ben E. King, Ringo Starr and Chic. He produced records for Aretha Franklin, Dionne Warwick and Whitney Houston. He wrote one of the climactic musical numbers (\"Everybody Rejoice\") for the Tony Award-winning Broadway musical and Academy Award-nominated film The Wiz. Luther\u2019s reach is extensive enough that CBS Sports has used his rendition of \u201cOne Shining Moment\u201d for their coverage of the NCAA Men\u2019s Basketball Tournament since 2003, and Luther performed the National Anthem at Super Bowl XXXI in January 1997 in New Orleans.\n\nLuther was a regular musical performer on the television shows Saturday Night Live, The Tonight Show (Johnny Carson and Jay Leno), Rosie O\u2019Donnell, The Arsenio Hall Show, Solid Gold and Soul Train and was a common performer at Washington DC events in the 1990\u2019s, including The People\u2019s Inaugural Celebration, A Gala for the President at Ford\u2019s Theatre, Christmas In Washington and A Capitol Fourth.\n\nLuther also appeared on Hollywood Squares and Family Feud, and tried his hand at acting on TV\u2019s In Living Color, 227, New York Undercover, Beverly Hills 90210 and Touched By An Angel and in the film The Meteor Man. Luther\u2019s songs have appeared in a vast number of movies, and he contributed original songs for sixteen films, including Bustin\u2019 Loose, The Goonies, Ruthless People, Made In Heaven, House Party, Hero, Money Train and Dr. Dolittle 2.\n\nFor almost 25 years, from 1981 to 2005, Luther dominated the American R&B music charts like no other artist before or since. In that span Luther released eight #1 R&B albums, seven #1 R&B singles and another five Top 20 R&B singles. He achieved crossover status with eight Billboard Top 10 albums, including reaching #1 with 2003\u2019s Dance With My Father; and another five Top 10 Billboard Hot 100 singles.\n\nFrom 1981 to 1996, Luther Vandross released 11 consecutive platinum/double platinum albums on CBS/Sony\u2019s Epic Records label; and at the time of his passing in 2005, 13 of Luther\u2019s 14 studio albums had gone Platinum or multi-platinum.\n\nLuther\u2019s success was not confined to the United States, with record sales of over 40 million worldwide since 1981, including four Top 10 UK albums (one #1). In March 1989, Luther Vandross was the first male artist to sell out 10 consecutive live shows at London\u2019s Wembley Arena.\n\nOverall, Luther received 31 Grammy Award nominations, winning eight times. Additionally, Luther won eight American Music Awards, including Favorite Soul/R&B Male Artist seven times.\n\nThroughout his distinguished career, Luther Vandross was active in charitable causes with the United Negro College Fund and the NY Chapter of the American Diabetes Association, in addition to performing at numerous charity concerts, most notably Michael Jackson\u2019s Heal The World concerts in the 1990\u2019s. Luther also contributed \u201cThe Christmas Song\u201d to the A Very Special Christmas 2 record released in 1992 to benefit the Special Olympics.\n\nLuther Vandross was a musical master whose style has influenced an entire generation of today's vocalists. His distinctive brand of satin smooth vocal magic moved international audiences and continues to touch people to this day.",

        "bio": "What is cool?  At its very essence, cool is all about what\u2019s happening next.  In popular culture, what\u2019s happening next is a kaleidoscope encompassing past, present and future: that which is about to happen may be cool, and that which happened in the distant past may also be cool.  This timeless quality, when it applies to music, allows minimalist debate \u2013 with few exceptions, that which has been cool will always be cool.\n\nFor nearly six decades, Miles Davis has embodied all that is cool \u2013 in his music (and most especially jazz), in his art, fashion, romance, and in his international, if not intergalactic, presence that looms strong as ever today.  2006 \u2013 The year in which Miles Davis was inducted into the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame on March 13th \u2013 is a land\u00admark year, commemorating the 80th anniversary of his birth on May 26, 1926, and the 15th anniversary of his death on September 28, 1991.  In between those two markers is more than a half-century of brilliance \u2013 often exasperating, brutally honest with himself and to others, uncompromising in a way that transcended mere intuition. \n\nIn carrying out what always seemed like a mission, Miles Dewey Davis III \u2013 musician, composer, arranger, producer, and band leader \u2013 was always in the right place at the right time, another defining aspect of cool.  Born in Alton, Illinois, and raised in East St. Louis, where his father was a dentist, Miles was given his first trumpet at age 13.  A child prodigy, his mastery of the instrument accelerated as he came under the spell of older jazzmen Clark Terry, Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Billy Eckstine, and others who passed through.  He accepted admission to the Juilliard School in 1944, but it was a ruse to get to New York and hook up with Bird and Diz.  Miles was 18.  Cool.\n\nWithin a year, he accomplished his goal.  He can be heard on sessions led by Parker that were released on Savoy in 1945 (with Max Roach), \u201946 (with Bud Powell), \u201947 (with Duke Jordan and J.J. Johnson), and \u201948 (with John Lewis).  In 1947, the Miles Davis All-Stars (with Bird, Roach, Lewis, and Nelson Boyd) debuted on Savoy.  His years on 52nd Street during the last half of the 1940s brought him into the bop orbit of musicians whose legends he would share before he was 25 years old. \n\nAt the turn of the decade into 1950, as Miles led his first small groups, an asso\u00adci\u00ada\u00adtion with Gerry Mulligan and arranger Gil Evans ushered in The Birth of the Cool (Capitol), a movement that challenged the dominance of bebop and hard-bop.  Miles\u2019 subsequent record dates as leader in the early \u201950s (on Blue Note, then Prestige) helped introduce Sonny Rollins, Jackie McLean, Horace Silver, and Percy Heath, among many others, establishing Miles\u2019 role as the premier jazz talent scout for the rest of his career. \n\nAn historic set at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1955 resulted in George Avakian signing Miles to Columbia Records, and led to the form\u00ada\u00adtion of his so-called \u201cfirst great quintet,\u201d featuring John Coltrane, Red Garland, Paul Chambers, and Philly Joe Jones (the \u2019Round About Midnight sessions).  Miles\u2019 30 years at Columbia was one of the longest exclusive signings in the history of jazz, and one that spanned at least a half-dozen distinct generations of changes in the music \u2013 virtually all of which were anticipated or led by Miles or his former sidemen.\n \nOver the course of those 30 years, service with Miles became an imprimatur for the Who\u2019s Who of jazzmen.  Kind Of Blue, undisputedly the coolest jazz album ever recorded, was done in 1959 with the second edition of Miles\u2019 \u201cfirst great quintet\u201d \u2013 principally Coltrane, Chambers, Cannonball Adderley, Bill Evans, and Jimmy Cobb \u2013 who stayed together until 1961. \n\nAfter several intermediate groups (which featured such giants as Hank Mobley, Wynton Kelly, Victor Feldman, and George Coleman), Miles\u2019 \u201csecond great quintet\u201d slowly coalesced over 1963-64, into the lineup of Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter, and Tony Williams (who was 17 years old when he joined Miles).  They recorded with producer Teo Macero and toured around the world together until 1968, achieving artistic and commercial success that was unprecedented in modern jazz. \n\n1968 was a cataclysmic year of sea change for Miles and for America, a year of upheaval \u2013 the escalation of the war in southeast Asia, the assassinations of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy, and the rise of the Black Power movement were among the factors that pushed Miles\u2019 music toward a more insistent electric (amplified) pulse.  At the same time, Miles dug the triple-whammy he heard in the music of James Brown, Jimi Hendrix, and Sly Stone.  What began in 1968 with Miles\u2019 quintet quietly adopting electric piano and guitar, blew up into a full-scale rock band sound on 1969\u2019s breakthrough double-LP Bitches Brew (which landed him on the cover of Rolling Stone, the first jazzman to appear on the magazine\u2019s front-page.  Very cool.)\n\nAt the core of Bitches Brew, whose sessions took place the week after the Woodstock festival in August 1969, there was the final small group known as the \u201cthird great quintet\u201d \u2013 Shorter, Chick Corea, Dave Holland, and Jack DeJohnette \u2013 augmented by John McLaughlin, Larry Young, Joe Zawinul, Bennie Maupin, Steve Grossman, Billy Cobham, Lenny White, Don Alias, Airto Moreira, Harvey Brooks, and former quintet members Hancock and Carter. \n\nSix months later in February 1970, Miles kicked off the Jack Johnson sessions, shuffling many of those same players over the next two months, plus Sonny Sharrock, Steve Grossman, Michael Henderson, Keith Jarrett and others.  In no uncertain terms, the jazz-rock fusion movement had been launched full-tilt, and the spirit of Miles permeated the three dominant bands who rocked the stages (as he did) of the Fillmores East and West (et alia) through the \u201970s and beyond \u2013 Weather Report, Return To Forever, and the Mahavishnu Orchestra.\n\nHis freewheeling lifestyle and high-energy forays into funk and R&B grooves somehow dovetailed with a period of declining health in the early \u201970s, until Miles finally went underground in 1975, after playing (what turned out to be) his final gig at New York\u2019s Central Park Music Festival that summer.  A series of live LPs (domestic and imported from Japan) and other archival releases from the \u201950s and \u201960s were made available over the next five years to fill the void. \n\nInto the \u201980s, Miles\u2019 reputation as talent scout extraordinaire went unquestioned.  He surfaced stronger than ever in 1981 on The Man With the Horn with a top-tier lineup of young players \u2013 Mike Stern, Marcus Miller, Bill Evans (no relation), Al Foster, and Mino Cinelu (all of whom went on to success\u00adful careers).  It was Miles\u2019 first LP to skirt the Billboard album chart\u2019s Top 50 since Bitches Brew, and the band was recorded live for the follow-up double-LP, 1982\u2019s We Want Miles.  They remained stable (abetted by John Scofield) in 1983 on Star People.  The lineup then morphed on 1984\u2019s Decoy, as Miller was replaced by Daryll \u2018Munch\u2019 Jones, Robert Irving III was added on synthe\u00adsiz\u00aders and programming, and Branford Marsalis shared saxophone parts with Evans. \n\nMiles\u2019 final album for Columbia Records was released in 1985, the cryptically titled You\u2019re Under Arrest.  It (re)-introduced Miles\u2019 nephew Vince Wilburn into the lineup (he played briefly on The Man With the Horn), as Bob Berg took over the big chair from Evans and Marsalis.  The album debuted two ballads that would be staples of Miles\u2019 performances for the rest of his career, Michael Jackson\u2019s \u201cHuman Nature\u201d and Cyndi Lauper\u2019s \u201cTime After Time.\u201d \n\nThe following year, Miles began recording for Warner Bros., a prolific period that yielded one new album every year (the first four co-produced with Marcus Miller): Tutu (1986), Music From Siesta (1987, a film soundtrack collabora\u00adtion with Miller), Live Around the World (1988), Amandla (1989), Dingo (1990, an orchestral collabora\u00adtion with Michel Legrand), and his final studio album. the hip-hop informed Doo-Bop (1991), whose title tune gave Miles a posthumous Rap/R&B hit single in 1992.\n\n\u201cMiles Dewey Davis III \u2013 trumpeter, visionary, and eternal modernist \u2013 was a force of nature,\u201d wrote Ashley Kahn (author of Kind Of Blue: The Making Of the Miles Davis Masterpiece, Da Capo, 2000) in the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame dinner journal on the occasion of Miles\u2019 induction.  \u201cWith an ear that disregarded categories of style, he sought out new musical worlds, and generations followed in his footsteps.  While the creative rush and experimental charge that come to most musicians in youth eventually run down, Davis held an exploratory edge for most of his 65 years.  It had to be fresh, or forget it.\u201d\n\nBeyond his defiant stance, his piercing glare, his amorous conquests and one-of-a-kind fashion statements \u2013 there was and always will be one eternal truth: the music of Miles Davis.\n\nIn 1996, five years after his death, Columbia/Legacy issued the first deluxe multi-disc box set in The Miles Davis Series, the 6-CD Miles Davis & Gil Evans: The Complete Columbia Studio Recordings, (collaborations from 1957-\u201968).  It went on to win three Grammy Awards \u2013 Best Historical Album, Best Album Notes, and Best Recording Package (Boxed) \u2013 the second of only three times in Grammy history that trifecta was ever achieved. \n\nLegacy\u2019s Miles Davis Series was unofficially inaugurated in 1997 with five double-CD live digipaks, including Black Beauty: Miles Davis at Fillmore West (April 1970, when Steve Grossman replaced Wayne Shorter) and Miles Davis at Fillmore (at the New York venue, June 1970, with Keith Jarrett in the new lineup), along with In Concert: Live At Philharmonic Hall (New York, September 1972); Dark Magus: Live At Carnegie Hall (New York, March 1974); and Live-Evil (New York, February & June 1970; and Washington, DC, December 1970).\n\n1998 brought the next two box sets: the Grammy Award-winning 6-CD Miles Davis Quintet 1965-\u201968: The Complete Columbia Studio Recordings; and the Grammy Award-winning 4-CD Complete Bitches Brew Sessions (of 1969-\u201970).  The fourth box set was issued in 2000, the 6-CD Miles Davis & John Coltrane: The Complete Columbia Recordings 1955-1961, which won two Grammy Awards, for Best Boxed Recording Package and Best Album Notes.\n\nIn 2001, one decade after his death \u2013 and in honor of his 75th birthday celebra\u00ad\u00adtion \u2013 Legacy formally (re-)launched The Miles Davis Series, with the original motion picture soundtrack album for Columbia Pictures\u2019 Finding Forrester (starring Sean Connery and directed by Gus Van Sant), consisting almost entirely of Miles Davis music.  Five new digitally remastered titles followed: \u2018Round About Midnight (with four bonus tracks from the original 1955-56 sessions, not heard on the original 1957 LP); Milestones (with all three known alternate takes from the 1958 LP sessions); Miles Davis At Newport (the full-length performance from the 1958 jazz festival); Jazz At The Plaza (also from 1958, unreleased until 1973, but out-of-print for nearly two decades); and Miles Davis & John Coltrane: The Best Of The Complete Columbia Recordings 1955-1961, a single-CD of tracks from the box set.\n\nLater on in 2001 came The Essential Miles Davis, the double-CD 23-track collec\u00adtion gathered from the discographies of the six companies for whom Miles did his most important recordings (Savoy, Capitol, Prestige, Blue Note, Columbia, and Warner Bros.).  The Columbia archives then surrendered a live concert treasure long considered to be a crucial \u2018missing link\u2019 in the Miles Davis iconography, with the release of the double-CD It\u2019s About That Time: Miles Davis Live At Fillmore East (March 7, 1970).  It was followed \u2013 on the fateful in-store day of September 11, 2001 \u2013 by the triple-CD box set The Complete In A Silent Way Sessions, covering those 1967-\u201969 dates.  In 2002, the three albums that came out of those sessions were restored, the classic In A Silent Way, and expanded editions of Filles De Kilimanjaro and Water Babies. \n\nThe Miles Davis Series returned in 2003, with the 5-CD box set The Complete Jack Johnson Sessions, chronicling those February-June 1970 studio dates that intro\u00adduced John McLaughlin.  (The resulting album, 1971\u2019s A Tribute To Jack Johnson, was reissued in January 2005, in conjunction with the Ken Burns PBS documentary, Unfor\u00adgiv\u00adable Blackness: The Rise And Fall Of Jack Johnson.)  Meanwhile, August 2004 brought the sixth box set, the 7-CD Seven Steps: The Complete Columbia Recordings Of Miles Davis 1963-1964, the largest volume ever produced in the series.\n\nIn 2005, Legacy commemorated the 50th anniversary year of Miles\u2019 original signing to Columbia in 1955, starting with the timely (February) release of My Funny Valentine for the first time on CD in the U.S. (recorded February 1964 at Lincoln Center\u2019s Philharmonic Hall in New York).  One week later came the \u2018DualDisc\u2019 configuration of Kind Of Blue, with the CD side containing the original album plus its only existing alternate take (\u201cFlamenco Sketches\u201d), and the DVD side containing a 25-minute mini-documentary, Made In Heaven. \n\nAs with its predecessor, the Seven Steps box set \u2018broke out\u2019 several titles as newly expanded editions in March 2005: Seven Steps To Heaven, Miles Davis In Europe, Four & More (the follow-up to My Funny Valentine), and Miles In Tokyo and Miles In Berlin (both issued for the first-time in the U.S.).  May brought \u2019Round About Midnight: Legacy Edition, the deluxe 2-CD version of  Miles\u2019 first full-length Columbia LP plus bonus tracks on disc one; with disc two comprising the Newport Jazz Festival perform\u00adance of \u201c\u2019Round Midnight\u201d (with Thelonious Monk) from 1955, plus the previously unissued 1956 Pasadena concert. \n\n2005 concluded with the September release of the 6-CD box set, The Cellar Door Sessions 1970, six complete performance sets at the Washington, D.C. nightclub in December 1970, by the lineup that starred Miles, Keith Jarrett, Gary Bartz, Michael Henderson, Jack DeJohnette, Airto Moreira, and (on the final night) guitarist John McLaughlin. \n\nAltogether since 1997, the Miles Davis Series has reissued digitally remastered and restored versions (many of them expanded editions) of:  \u2018Round About Midnight (1957), Miles Ahead (1957), Porgy and Bess (1958), Milestones (1958), Miles Davis At Newport (1958), Jazz At The Plaza (1958), Kind Of Blue (1959), Sketches Of Spain (1960), Someday My Prince Will Come (1961), Miles Davis at Carnegie Hall \u2013 The Complete Concert (1961), In Person: Friday Night At the Blackhawk (1961), In Person: Satur\u00adday Night At the Blackhawk (1961), Quiet Nights (1962), Seven Steps To Heaven (1963), Miles Davis In Europe (1963), Miles In Tokyo (1964), Miles In Berlin (1964), My Funny Valentine (1965), E.S.P.

The Miles Davis Story, the first major documentary to be produced on Miles in nearly 15 years, was issued in 2002 on VHS and interactive DVD formats.\n\nThe 8 critically acclaimed box sets of The Miles Davis Series comprise:\n\n\u25cf Miles Davis & Gil Evans: The Complete Columbia Studio Recordings (released in 1996), the 6-CD box set which won Grammy Awards for Best Historical Album, Best Album Notes, and Best Recording Package;\n\n\u25cf Miles Davis Quintet 1965-\u201968: The Complete Columbia Studio Recordings (February 1998), the 6-CD box set which won the Grammy Award for Best Album Notes;\n\n\u25cf The Complete Bitches Brew Sessions (October 1998); the 4-CD boxed set which won the Grammy as Best Boxed Recording Package;\n\n\u25cf Miles Davis & John Coltrane: The Complete Columbia Recordings 1955-1961 (February 2000), the 6-CD box set which won Grammy Awards for Best Boxed Recording Package and Best Album Notes; \n\n\u25cf The Complete In A Silent Way Sessions (September 2001), the 3-CD box set;\n\n\u25cf The Complete Jack Johnson Sessions (August 2003), the 5-CD box set which won the Grammy Award for Best Boxed Or Special Limited Edition Package;\n\n\u25cf Seven Steps: The Complete Columbia Recordings Of Miles Davis 1963-1964 (August 2004), the 7-CD box set; and\n\n\u25cf The Cellar Door Sessions 1970 (September 2005), the 6-CD box set.",

        "bio": "Beginning his career as an outlaw to the Nashville establishment, Johnny Cash has come to define country music over the last 40 years. At first, his unique mix of hillbilly music with gospel and blues made him a perfect fit at Sam Phillips' Sun records, where he recorded such classics as \"Folsom Prison Blues\" and \"I Walk The Line.\" From there, Johnny signed with Columbia records and embarked on one of the most remarkable musical careers of the twentieth century. Transforming into The Man In Black, Johnny spent more than thirty years reinventing and contradicting himself--breaking all of the rules of traditional country music only to emerge as the ultimate mythic hero and archetype of the genre.\n\nNo other artist has touched the world of music quite like Johnny Cash. He is the only person to be inducted into the Country Music Hall Of Fame, The Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame AND The Songwriter's Hall Of Fame. His very name is synonymous with the fight for the rights of the poor and downtrodden and the image of \"The Man In Black\" is as deeply American as the stars and stripes themselves. Johnny Cash is America.",

Waits, in possibly the finest voice of his career, worked with a veteran team of gifted musicians and longtime co-writer/producer Kathleen Brennan. From the opening horn-fueled chug of \u201cChicago,\u201d to the closing barroom chorale of \u201cNew Year\u2019s Eve,\u201d Bad As Me displays the full career range of Waits\u2019 songwriting, from beautiful ballads like \u201cLast Leaf,\u201d to the avant cinematic soundscape of \u201cHell Broke Luce,\u201d a battlefront dispatch. On tracks like \u201cTalking at the Same Time,\u201d Waits shows off a supple falsetto, while on blues burners like \u201cRaised Right Men\u201d and the gospel tinged \u201cSatisfied\u201d he spits, stutters and howls. Like a good boxer, these songs are lean and mean, with strong hooks and tight running times. A pervasive sense of players delighting in each other\u2019s musical company brings a feeling of loose joy even to the album\u2019s saddest songs.",

        "bio": "Blaqk Audio, the electronic side endeavor of AFI's Jade Puget and Davey Havok debuting August 14 in the form of the debut album CexCells actually had its genesis some five or six years ago-even further back if one considers the duo's shared love for the electronic music of the 1980s.\n\nHavok, who counts Devo's Freedom of Choice and Duran Duran's self-titled debut among the first albums he owned, saw his tastes evolve over the years from the easy on the ears synth pop of Erasure and Pet Shop Boys to Depeche Mode and ultimately to the heavier, darker Skinny Puppy, Ministry, Front 242 and Lords of Acid. Later, Havok immersed himself in the \"futurepop\" genre, which combined dark dance-y electronica with melodic vocals. From roughly 1999 to 2003, his contemporary musical diet consisted almost exclusively of artists falling under the industrial/ebm/futurepop/bigbeat/trance umbrella.\n\nPuget, who joined AFI roughly around the same time of Havok's futurepop immersion, shared his bandmate's long-standing love of electronic music. He soon found himself indulging his passion for Daft Punk, Depeche Mode, Ministry, Squarepusher, Nitzer Ebb, and Front 242, spending a great deal of time programming electronic music, which in turn led to a plan to start an entirely electronic side project: no organic instruments, just synths, keyboards, drum machines, and software.\n\nHowever, AFI's writing, recording and touring regimen left Puget and Havok precious little time to work on Blaqk Audio until the summer of 2006, when they began to write songs for what would become CexCells, making use of the scant downtime afforded by travel intervals as AFI traversed the globe on tour. Music was programmed and assembled on the road, melodies and vocals written abroad and at home, then finally the two would converge in Los Angeles to track vocals.\n\nThe end result was the culmination of their love and appreciation of electronic music in all its forms. Mixed by Dave Bascombe (Depeche Mode, Tears For Fears, Suede), CexCells expands upon and fully indulges the dark electronic textures that have influenced and pervaded the duo's work for years. The results range from evocation of prime era Depeche Mode and early Ministry (\"Stiff Kittens,\" \"Where Would You Like Them Left?,\" \"Bitter For Sweet\") to four on the floor club-friendly fare (\"On A Friday,\" \"Snuff on Digital\"-the latter being the first song written for the project, dating back to 2001-2002) to vulnerable balladry (\"Wake Up, Open the Door and Escape to the Sea,\" \"The Fear of Being Found\")-all suffused with the common threads of Havok's signature dark vocal and lyrical stylings and Puget's epic, emotional arrangements.",

        "bio": "Getting an opportunity to make an impact by playing music is a dream for many bands. But getting a second chance, according to Yellowcard frontman Ryan Key, is a blessing.\n\nYellowcard returned to the spotlight in 2011 after a three-year hiatus with the energized When You\u2019re Through Thinking, Say Yes. The album was a renaissance of sorts for the Jacksonville natives, as its 10 tracks played out lik\ne the band never spent any time apart. A logical progression from 2007\u2019sPaper Walls, the group managed to capture elements of its entire discography with the album, which was welcomed by patient fans and praised by critics alike. Say Yes inspired a winding nine months of touring that took the band to over 30 different countries, a world tour that served as a reconnection with old, diehard fans and an instant way to reach new, younger listeners.\n\n\u201cThe tours we got to do last year, the bands we got to tour with, were incredible,\u201d Key says. \u201cWe wanted to stay current and matter to younger fans, because making new fans is important to us, and at the same time, we didn\u2019t want to turn our back on our old fans because they\u2019re essential to our existence. We couldn\u2019t make new fans without our old ones? When you\u2019re at a Yellowcard show if you\u2019re not a fan, you look at someone who is and think, \u2018Why am I not a fan of that? Why am I not enjoying this like that person is? I want that.\u2019 That\u2019s amazing for us.\u201d\n\nThe extensive touring schedule in support of Say Yes was more inspiring than exhausting. The band that put out the acclaimed Ocean Avenue (2003) nearly a decade ago, and fan favorites Lights and Sounds (2006) and Paper Walls (2007) after that, was still feeling energized and ready to move. \u201cWe got back from tour and we were still so excited about doing this,\u201d Key says. \u201cWe wanted to keep the ball rolling.\u201d So Key, violinist Sean Mackin, guitarist Ryan Mendez, new bassist Josh Portman and drummer Longineu Parsons decided to head back into the studio with almost no time off to record a new album.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re better at balancing the band and our personal lives than we have ever been before, and part of that comes with being 30 years old and not 20,\u201d Key says of the band\u2019s desire to keep its momentum going. \u201cWe all want to work together more than we ever have, and that\u2019s what drove us back together after being away from each other for three years.\u201d The decision to get back into the studio so soon brought along some pressure at first, but Key says that was all self-induced. \u201cAfter a while, we decided, \u2018This is what we do. We know exactly what we\u2019re doing, let\u2019s sit down and write some music.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe resulting album, titled Southern Air, will be Yellowcard\u2019s sixth studio effort and second for Hopeless Records. And according to Key, it was the easiest writing and recording experience of the band\u2019s decade-plus long career. He describes a \u201cbrotherhood\u201d that he shared with Mendez, Mackin. LP, and long-time producer\n\nNeal Avron during the meat of the recording sessions. \u201cThere was this bond, this camaraderie, a positive energy in the room,\u201d Key recalls in a hushed tone. \u201cWe all got so excited about every part of every song, working with each other on everything.\u201d More passionate than ever before, Yellowcard churned out a holistic effort as the self-induced pressure evaporated from the songwriting.\n\nThe album\u2019s title provides a loose concept for the album, centering around the experience Key had while Yellowcard was on its hiatus. Moving back to Athens, Georgia, to spend more time with his family than he had since his high school years gave Key some perspective into what his priorities are. \u201cI think this record, in a lot of ways, examines how much better that time made my life, how much of a positive influence that had on me,\u201d Key says, \u201cand how much I know now that I need that in my life, that southern air.\u201d\n\nThe rocking title track certainly hits home on that concept, with Key rounding out the album by singing, \u201cThis southern air is in my lungs, it\u2019s in every word I\u2019ve sung / It seems the only truth I know, this will always be home.\u201d Musically, Yellowcard\u2019s pounding pop-punk sound is abundant (\u201cAwakening,\u201d \u201cRivertown Blues\u201d), while of course highlighting the trademark violin, especially in first released song \u201cAlways Summer.\u201d Southern Air has every essential element of past Yellowcard albums, but at the same time still feels fresh and new. It could very well be the band\u2019s best work, and it\u2019s because of an intangible feeling you get when you listen to it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to answer that question, which I think is our best,\u201d Key says. \u201cBut I really think there\u2019s something special about this record. And I don\u2019t necessarily mean how many copies it\u2019s going to sell or anything like that, I just think there\u2019s something special here and I hope people see that too.\u201d\n\nNot bad for a band trying to make the best out of a second chance.",
